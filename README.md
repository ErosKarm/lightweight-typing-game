# Lightweight Typing Test Game

This is a lightweight typing test game, where you can test your typing speed with 4 different types of typing tests - 10 words, 25 words, 50 words, and 100 words. The typing speed is calculated using the `performance.now()` method, which gives accurate responses.

Words used in the game are generated using the [Random Words](https://github.com/apostrophecms/random-words) package.

The files are structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

The words per minute (WPM) is calculated using the average word length that is currently presented in the game, which gives a more accurate WPM.
