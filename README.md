# Lightweight Typing Test Game

This is a lightweight typing test game, where you can test your typing speed with 4 different types of typing tests - 10 words, 25 words, 50 words, and 100 words. The typing speed is calculated using the performance.now() method, which gives accurate responses.

Words used in the game are generated using the Random Words package.

The files are structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

The words per minute (WPM) is calculated using the average word length that is currently presented in the game, which gives a more accurate WPM.
